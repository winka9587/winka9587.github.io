### pytorch3d

#### CUB_HOME

~~~
# which nvcc
# /usr/local/cuda-11.8/bin/nvcc
export CUB_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.8/include/cub
~~~

#### You need C++17 to compile PyTorch

https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/issues/1657

modifying the line of setup.py :

~~~
 extra_compile_args = {"cxx": ["-std=c++14"]} 
~~~

into

~~~
extra_compile_args = {"cxx": ["-std=c++17"]} 
~~~

and

~~~
 nvcc_args.append("-std=c++14") 
~~~

into

~~~
nvcc_args.append("-std=c++17")
~~~

### kaolin 0.10.0

#### error:identifier "CHECK_EQ" is undefined

change 

~~~
CHECK_EQ
~~~

to 

~~~
TORCH_CHECK_EQ
~~~


#### error: no suitable conversion function from "const at::DeprecatedTypeProperties" to "c10::ScalarType" exists

~~~
.type()
~~~

to

~~~
.scalar_type()
~~~

#### No module named 'distutils.msvccompiler'

降低setuptool版本

~~~
pip install setuptools==64.0.3
~~~


#### error: Setup script exited with error: library mach has Fortran sources but no Fortran compiler found
